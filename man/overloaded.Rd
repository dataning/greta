\description{
greta provides a wide range of methods to apply common R
  functions and operations to \code{greta_array} objects. A few of these
  functions and operators are not associated with a class system, so they are
  overloaded here. This should not affect normal use of these functions, but
  they need to be documented to satisfy CRAN's check.
